              <h3>The Impact of Saturn Return</h3>
              <p>A Saturn return is when transiting Saturn in the sky reaches the exact position, by sign and degree, to where it was at the moment of your birth. You’ll probably feel this energy even before it reaches the exact degree. Once Saturn moves into your natal Saturn sign, the process begins and this planet’s presence is known.</p>
              <p>Every time a planet in the sky meets up to the exact degrees of the same planet in your birth chart, you experience a “return.” For example, every year we experience a solar return on our birthday, when the sun finally meets the exact degree as it was when we were born. While the sun’s placement is the same, the rest of the planets are in different signs. Astrologers analyze the new planets, aspects, and conversations between signs and planets to reveal themes for the coming year. You can think of your Saturn return almost like a birthday (a once-every-29-years birthday). But instead of solar themes—like being the center of attention, receiving gifts, and making well-wishes for health and vitality—this period brings up Saturnian themes instead.</p>
              <p>When Saturn is involved, think: responsibilities, rules, restrictions, obligations, challenges, and lessons. Sometimes tough ones. It’s like a cosmic check-in—and check-up—from the Lord of Karma himself.</p>
              <p>This is your astrological coming-of-age story. It is important to remember that Saturn’s job is to show you the areas of your life where you are the hardest on yourself. You are being pushed to level up to the next stage of life. After all, Saturn is the planetary taskmaster, and at this time, he will likely hold your feet to the proverbial fire.</p>

              <h3>The Impact of Mercury Retrograde</h3>
              <p>When Mercury is in retrograde, technology, communication, travel, logic, and information all get disrupted, but understanding Mercury retrograde’s meaning, the risks and benefits behind it, the sign it's in, as well as how long it lasts can help you deal with astrology’s most nerve-wracking event.</p>
              <p>The planet Mercury is associated with communication, information, electronics, travel, and clear thinking. So, when it’s retrograde, we have to be ready for a slowdown in all of those areas. Things break. Projects stall. We lose things. Breakups happen. Schedules are thrown off.</p>
              <p>This planet's reputation for really screwing things up is real, but it's also due to the fast-paced lifestyle we're so used to living. In our technology-focused society where emails, texts, and reliable WiFi are everything, the planet of communication has a big job.</p>
              <p>So when Mercury goes haywire during its retrograde phase, it hits us where it hurts. After all, you might be reading this article on your phone—all between Snaps, texts, booking flights, and mapping your route to the restaurant you made an online reservation for. Understandably, if your phone suddenly shuts down, a message gets lost, or travel is delayed, you’re majorly inconvenienced.</p>

              <h3>The Role of Planets in Astrology</h3>
              <p>In astrology, the ten planetary bodies in our solar system each have a "personality"—a symbolic meaning and agency behind their energy. As they travel through the sky, passing through the twelve signs of the zodiac, their personality comes through in various ways. On this page, you'll discover the meaning of each planet, its orbits and retrograde calendars, as well as the interactions they make with one another—causing energetic shifts for us here on Earth.</p>
              <p>It's important to note that the definition of a planet in astrology differs slightly from that in astronomy. Remember, astrology has been around for 2,000 years, and first observed with the naked eye. In the case of Pluto, for example, there has been much debate from modern astronomers as to whether its size classifies it as an official planet. It is currently dubbed a "dwarf planet," but when looking at an astrological chart, it holds the same weight as the rest of the interstellar team. The moon (a satellite of Earth) and sun (a star) are also considered planets for astrological purposes, though neither go through a retrograde period.</p>
              <p>In astrology, planetary alignment is significant in more than one way. First of all, the position of the planets in the sky at the time of your birth reveal significant information about how you see the world, your habits and traits, belief systems, and strengths and weaknesses. Every planet rules over some general domains, giving astrologers insight into the way you function and interact with others. To put it simply, here's what each planet represents:</p>
